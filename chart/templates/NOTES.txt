Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

The IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) webhook has been deployed to your cluster.

To verify the installation, check that the webhook pod is running:

  kubectl get pods -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l app=pod-identity-webhook

To use IRSA with your service accounts, annotate them with the IAM role ARN:

  kubectl annotate serviceaccount -n <namespace> <service-account-name> {{ .Values.podIdentityWebhook.config.annotationPrefix }}/role-arn=arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/<role-name>

Make sure your AWS IAM role has a trust relationship with your OIDC provider.
